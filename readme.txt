BrowserCall lets your website visitors communicate with your business through Click-to-Call based on WebRTC.

== Description ==
  
BrowserCall is a plugin that lets your website visitors communicate with your business through click-to-call functionality. Install TEVOX Browsercall on your website and give your visitors the ability to call your customer service or sales team directly from their browser. 
This software allows you to:

- Create personal, human relationships with your customers and visitors
- Answer questions & provide customer support
- Engage in conversations
- Build trust and develop relationships 
- Win customers!

BrowserCall is a tool that revolutionizes the way you communicate with your customers. It gives you the ability to communicate with them in a channel that no other company is doing, creating that personal human experience that allows you to provide the highest level of customer service. 

In turn, you'll see less refunds, better engagement which goes directly into your bottom line.
  
TEVOX enables voice calls through any computer, tablet or smart phone – right from a webpage. Your customers call through their browser using their microphone. They don’t need to look up or dial or even pay for an outgoing call.

The service is based upon HTML5 features webRTC and WebSocket. There is no need for any plug-in installation or registration/setup needed by the visitors of the website. With Chrome, Firefox already supporting webRTC (and more likely to join in the future), there are more than 1 billion users who can already access this feature in their browser.  Calls can be anonymous with no registration needed and users can register or provide their details when additional interaction is needed.
